# Mistyped - URL Checker

Mistyped is a web application built with React in the frontend and Golang in the backend. Its primary goal is to assist users in checking for similar URLs by considering possible typos. For example, if a user provides "youtube.com," the application will check for variations such as "yiutube.com," "yputube.com," and so on.

## Features

- **URL Similarity Check:** Enter a URL, and Mistyped will analyze possible typos to find similar URLs.
